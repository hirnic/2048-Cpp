# 2048-In-C++
This is the first game I made in C++. Enjoy!

I would like to thank my wife for being so supportive while I grinded on those coding tutorials for 12 hours a day all week. You are the best part of my entire life. I love you darlin'!

Now for the not-so-humble part.

I would like to take this opportunity to pat myself on the back. I am a self-taught coder and I had never seen C++ code 7 days ago. Now I am able to scavenge enough information online to make an animated video game! (Who are we kidding? A game with __some__ animations is an animated video game about as much as a husky is a wolf.) It was hard, but also rewarding. Stay tuned for my next game! (Ogame with AI bots)
